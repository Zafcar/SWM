# SSS: Smart SWM System


SSS is a flagship project buit by @Zafcar and @KarthikPai14 as part of the Prothon 2023- a 24 hour prototype development competition held at Dayanand Sagar Unviersity, March 2023, under the guidance of Atal Incubation and NITI Aayog. This project was awarded 3rd out of 25 odd projects developed during the protothon. 

This project is our solution to the ever continuing SWH issues in Bengaluru, mainly due to shortfalls related to management of large amounts of waste. Our project consists of a user interface app, agent dashboard and hardware system. The hardware systems captures GPS coordinates as well as weight of waste from the collection vehicle. This data is transmitted and displayed on the dashboard. Basic analysis is also presented. This ensures more relability and accountabilty.

Yet to be done:
- Hardware and software integration.
- Development of app based application for citizens.
